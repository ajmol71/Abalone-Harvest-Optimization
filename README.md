# Abalone-Harvest-Optimization
Data Analysis and Visualization with R



# Project-Description
This project uses R to analyze a study of abalone characteristics, such as weight, sex, and width, to consider the optimal harvest point to ensure future harvest profits while preserving the viability of the abalone population.


# Molitor Data Analysis 1
These files include descriptive analytics and visualizations to demonstrate the distribution of data regarding key variables like volume, weight, and class. These variables are analyzed independently and in conjunction to one another to draw conclusions about the dataset.


# Molitor Data Analysis 2
These files include regression analytics to determine key variables in the prediction of abalone harvest volume. Findings are used to identify an optimal harvest weight to preserve infant population while optimizing the harvest volume. Conclusions are also used to highlight inadequacies in the dataset and the methods used for gathering key metrics.
